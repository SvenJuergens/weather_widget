# TYPO3 Weather Widget
TYPO3 Extension:

> A simple Dashboard Widget that displays the current weather. So you don't actually need to go outside or open the curtains.

An extension strongly inspired by [Bolt Weather Widget](https://github.com/bobdenotter/weatherwidget). :)
many thanks therefore to [Bob the Otter](https://github.com/bobdenotter) and [Michael Schams](https://github.com/schams-net/) for some hints in the implementation in TYPO3.

Installation:

```bash
composer require svenjuergens/weather-widget
```

or use the ExtensionManager.
